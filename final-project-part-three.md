# The final data story
[The Case against Filibuster](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/the-case-against-filibuster/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II

In this section, I am gonna address the critique and feedback from interviews one-by-one:

1. "For the "What is [a] Filibuster", where did this definition come from? If it came from a secondary source, you'd want to cite it."
Done. All material is duly cited now. 
   
2. "I'm surprised everyone you spoke with understood what a filibuster is!"
For starters, I made a mistake in the interview script, where I only mentioned the summarized version of the responses. Interviewees did understand the filibuster but it took them a lot of time and questions from me to reach that point. Unfortunately, I did not document that part on my GitHub in the research section, as I should have.  Coming to the point of how I addressed this issue, I mainly added one more section that uses the analogy of a friend group deciding which movie to watch as the setup for explaining the filibuster. I think it should be easy now for readers to understand what a filibuster exactly is. 

3. "You'll want to replace things like the screengrab of the movie and any other photos that are copyright protected. See the library guide for more"
Addressed in the references section below. 

4. "I would dig more into the "how to reform" the filibuster section - this seems like an area that could use some further definition."
I have added more explanation in the slide preceding it. This should also make the transition and flow of the story smoother.  

5. "First viz is helpful - could probably play around a bit with the colors, etc. Not sure the evolving Senate dynamics line graph matches the title. Good start on the wireframes! Might benefit from establishing a unique color scheme that would apply throughout."
I have changed the title to a simpler, but more descriptive one. As for the color scheme of the overall story, I have chosen black-and-white. I believe that the topic is serious, and thus, a black-and-white color scheme is appropriate here. The visualizations are an exception here. Mainly, I have used the default blue, but in one visualization, where there is mention of political parties, I have used their respective party colors (i.e. blue for Democrats). Using color for visualizations over a black-and-white color scheme also makes them more pop-out, which is a positive I believe. To match the color scheme, I also made all the pictures black-and-white for consistency.

## The audience
I have chosen to stick with my previously identified audience i.e. US residents of voting age. However, it was mentioned that what about people who are not interested in this at all? I added a resource to learn more about this issue in my call to action for them. I also replaced one of the headings with "Why you should care?", I think it would be more impactful in catching their attention. 

## References
A few notes about the images: All the images of Senators are in the public domain, and hence, require no attribution. Bernie Sander's picture is an exception, for his picture, I have added the due credit. As for the screengrab from the movie, that is also available under a Creative Commons license, and as per the library guide, fine to use with due attribution, which I have done now. 

# Final thoughts
I did run out of time in my presentation during class. If I were to revisit, I would perhaps talk more about examples from history as the starting point of conversation, which is likely to grab more attention.
