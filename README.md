# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably (read: definitely) hire me. 

# About me
Hi! I am graduate student at CMU's Heinz College studying Public Policy. My pronouns are he/him. After graduation, I will work in the Central Bank of Pakistan. 

# What I hope to learn
I want to learn the cool visualizations which you see on sites like fivethirtyeight and Chartr and you can tell immediately that they were not made in excel.

# Examples
You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it.
