# Critique by design - NYC Pizza Scene

## Chosen Visualization:
NYC Slice
https://elkue.com/nyc-slice/
https://data.world/makeovermonday/2023w5

## Feedback:

(1)	Usefulness: I do not think that the information is particularly useful for an average New Yorker, because if I am looking for a pizza place to grab a slice from, the price is not likely to be the only factor in my consideration. A big factor for me would also be the quality of pizza. That information is missing from this visualization. And while it still does a good job at explaining the price trends, for an average person, it is an insufficient source for making the decision.

(2)	Completeness: Again, I have scored it average here, mostly for small reasons. For one, there is a legend missing here to interpret the map. I am not sure what is the value of red dots as compared to orange dots. What is their categorization? Is it plain versus pepperoni pizza slices? Or is it price-wise categorization? I would include a legend to explain that. The second visualization of line chart is better in this sense, it is a simple chart that provides all the information about price trends over years.

(3)	Perceptibility: The first map visualization scores poorly on this. I believe that it is largely because of the colored dots here. It takes more effort to discern between red and orange dots on the map. A simple solution would be to use two different colors which are not neighbors on the color palette. Like perhaps, green and red would be good here, or blue and yellow as well.

(4)	Truthfulness: The visualization is indeed accurate and reliable. It is factual in the sense that there is no subjective data point in the dataset to begin with. As in, for example, there could have been the author’s ratings of the restaurants, but he avoided doing that. The other main data point is pricing, which can be easily contested by the restaurant owners if it is wrong. My only concern about the validity here would be that this data is collected over the years, which means that restaurant A had the same prices in 2017 as of a random restaurant B which the author had yet to visit. When the author finally visited restaurant B after two years, inflation had a significant impact on the price. Thereby, making it a bit wonky to compare the prices of one restaurant to another. One way to get around this would be to calculate prices again by factoring in baseline inflation this time. That will make the prices across years comparable.

(5)	Intuitiveness:  On the original website where the data is published, there is a whole guide accompanying the visualization. There is also a filter button where you can look up the data of a specific pizza place as well. I think that makes it easy to play around with the data, so anyone can tinker around with it to better understand it. The con in terms of interpretability would be the absence of legend for the map, as noted above as well.  So simply adding a legend will make the visualization more intuitive.

(6)	Aesthetics: I think it is somewhere in the middle. But that’s appreciable because it does not take too much away from the main point of the visualization. There is potential in the map visualization, where I think I would try to use average prices by neighborhood rather than listing every single pizza place as a separate dot. That will allow me to make that heat map thing which would be more pleasing, I believe. The individual data of each pizza place is already there as a table accompanying the map, so we will not be losing any such information either way.

(7)	Engagement: I think it has a somewhat 'share' factor. Like if I were living in New York, I would perhaps share it with my friends there. Pizza is a big thing in NYC so this data set will be interesting to the New Yorkers. There is not much to learn about the topic further, but I do believe, it may ignite simple, fun discussions/debate about which pizza place is better. 

The primary audience for this visualization would likely be: 
•	Local New Yorkers who maybe interested in discovering new pizza places
•	Foodies and bloggers who have a vested/professional interest in the local culinary scene. 
•	Tourists may also be the target audience of this dataset. 

I think the visualization is somewhat effective for bloggers perhaps, but I think that residents and tourists will probably still go to the traditional sites like Yelp and Google Reviews to find places to grab pizza. This could still be a good additional source of data. I have not checked it, but I think it would also matter, how the visualization shows up on the phone since that is where a lot of people go to check recommendations/reviews/discover new spots. 

I think it is more useful than the previous method since it does the categorization for you. These categories nudge you to think in a particular direction which is I believe useful for organizing your thoughts. The old one merely divided into basic questions which you would have thought about anyway.
