# Outline
 
This project focuses on advocating for the abolition of filibusters, a crucial and often contentious aspect of the legislative process in the U.S. Senate. My objective is twofold: to educate about the filibuster's history and current role, and to advocate for its removal. I will delve into the evolution of the filibuster, highlighting its impact on lawmaking and governance. While acknowledging the counterargument that filibusters can foster debate, I will provide evidence and reasoning to refute this perspective, ultimately leading to the conclusion that the drawbacks of filibusters outweigh their purported benefits, thus underscoring the need for their abolition.

My call of action would be twice: 

•	As an engaged citizen, I can have a crucial role in abolishing filibusters to allow for smoother legislative processes. I can make a difference by contacting my representatives and actively discussing this issue with them, especially during the election cycle.

•	As a political analyst or a member of a think tank, I am in a unique position to influence the debate around the filibuster. With access to tools like policy analysis, public opinion research, and strategic advocacy, I can effectively argue for the abolition of the filibuster.

### Story Arc and Possible Accompanying Visualizations:
1)	Introduction: Introduce what a filibuster is, its historical roots, and its role in the legislative process. This sets the stage for understanding the current debate.
Visualization to accompany: A timeline with illustrations that will show the significant changes in the law pertaining to filibusters.

2)	Impact Analysis: Analyze the impact of filibusters on lawmaking and governance.
Visualizations to accompany: Perhaps a simple bar chart that shows the number of filibusters in each year. Another visualization to break down the filibusters into Democratic vs. Republican motions.

3)	Two specific examples of laws that were hindered by Filibusters. No visualization is needed here, I think. Perhaps, I will also add a couple of funny/interesting (e.g. longest speech ever, unusual tactics to prolong filibusters, etc.)
   
4)	Argument on how the filibuster empowers a small segment of America.
Visualization: A heatmap to show the difference between the weightage of each state in the house and senate and how filibuster disturbs that.

5)	Counterargument: Address the common argument that filibusters foster debate and present evidence and reasoning to refute this.
   
6)	Conclusion: The call to action would be two-pronged, targeting both engaged citizens and policy analysts or think tank members.

# The data

Number of cloture motions: This dataset is simply listing the number of all cloture motions from 1917-2024. I would use this dataset to simply draw the trend over the years and drive the point that filibuster has increasingly become a polarized tool to block bills. I would also be able to bifurcate which party controlled each session of Congress.

Timeline:
This report lists all the developments pertaining to laws and rules for the filibuster. I would use this to make a timeline visualization of how things have changed over time.

Public Support for Abolishing Filibusters:
This is a survey conducted from January 14 to 18, 2022. Data for Progress conducted a survey of 1,282 likely voters nationally using web panel respondents. I will use this data to build support for my case of abolishing filibusters.

# Method and medium
I would use Shorthand to build my story and also present it from there. I would not need PowerPoint or any other supporting platform for my presentation.
