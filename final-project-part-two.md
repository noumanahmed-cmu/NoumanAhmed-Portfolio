# Wireframes / storyboards
I chose to build a draft of my story in shorthand directly. My approach was to first simply put all the section slides in the sequence I wanted without putting the actual content in those slides. After that, I first filled up the slides with content from last week and then the rest. As I progressed, I had to reshuffle the sequence of information and story, eliminate few points, and added some new. Below is my shorthand story:
