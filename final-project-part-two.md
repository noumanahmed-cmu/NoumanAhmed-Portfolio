# Wireframes / storyboards
I chose to build a draft of my story in shorthand directly. My approach was to first simply put all the section slides in the sequence I wanted without putting the actual content in those slides. After that, I first filled up the slides with content from last week and then the rest. As I progressed, I had to reshuffle the sequence of information and story, eliminate few points, and added some new. Below is my shorthand story:

# User research 

## Target audience

My target audience is US residents, who are above the age of 18 (i.e. voting age), and who have no idea of what a filibuster is. I wanted to keep the last criteria because filibuster is a complex topic to understand for someone who does not have much interest in US domestic politics. And so I wanted to gauge whether they would understand it correctly by just reading my story. 

## Interview script

| S. No. | Question                                  | Code name: Abbottabad                 | Code name: Karachi                  | Uzma: Sindh                       |
|-------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1     | Can you briefly explain the filibuster?  | The filibuster it's like this Senate rule where they need 60 or more votes to pass laws. If a law is being passed, and you want to stop, you start debating to avoid voting. This allows people to not let the bill pass and continue the debate forever. |                                         |                                   |
| 2     | Potential advantages of the filibuster   | It gives strength to the minority voters in a certain way I guess. There is some, it can potentially stop a bad bill from being passed. It ensures debate, which is healthy. Don’t recall anymore. |                                     |                                   |
| 3     | Potential disadvantages of the filibuster | Undue advantage to opposite voters if 60 voters are not in favor, kind of hindering 51 voter principle. Useless debate that takes away from the actual content of the bill just because there are differences on political views. Has led to a lower number of bills being passed. |                                     |                                   |
| 4     | Thoughts on potential reforms or changes  | Would make more sense if they do the time limit thing in some way at least. The interviewee asked me some questions to fully understand. He asked when the rule was removed. I agree with the idea, the law-making process will be easy. |                                     |                                   |
| 5     | Enough data points to form an opinion?    | I believe so, but this is kind of hard to answer, there may be data stuff which I don’t know about but is important to this issue. | I think I had enough data. | Yes. The data went quite back in history. |
| 6     | Were you convinced to act on the call to action? | Somewhat yes but I am in general not very sure if I will do it. I am lazy, I won’t do it. I am okay with calling representatives, but only calling since this is low effort. | | |
| 7     | Overall design and presentation rating    | 8. I think it is mostly okay and I understood. | 6, too text-heavy, sentences need to be simplified, too long. | 9. Because the flow was very smooth. The color scheme was consistent. I don’t remember the font being bad either. |
| 8     | Clarity of visualizations and data        | Yes (Focused on text). | Yes (Asked me to see them again and then answered yes). | Yeah, they made sense. |
| 9     | Engaging or persuasive design features    | Extracts from history were really fun. The example about the guy who asked his intern to hold a bucket for urination was amusing. That vs. thing (talking about the comparison of productivity of the senate). | | |
| 10    | Lacking or detrimental design features    | Passages could be clearer. Not design but text. | Not really. | Nothing. |
| 11    | Contribution of color to overall impact   | I guess yes, I don’t remember color as such. | I think I am neutral. I remember the color was black, not sure how it matters. | Consistent throughout which was nice, it was not flashy but not dull either. |
| 12    | Concluding thoughts or additional comments | Nothing to say on my end. Simplify the content, it is still a bit difficult for me to understand the topic. Made me think about a call to action. It was persuasive, I did not know about this topic before, but it could use some more explanation. | | |
