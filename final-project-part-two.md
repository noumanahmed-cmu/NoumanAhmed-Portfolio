# Wireframes / storyboards
I chose to build a draft of my story in shorthand directly. My approach was to first simply put all the section slides in the sequence I wanted without putting the actual content in those slides. After that, I first filled up the slides with content from last week and then the rest. As I progressed, I had to reshuffle the sequence of information and story, eliminate few points, and added some new. Below is my shorthand story:

# User research 

## Target audience

My target audience is US residents, who are above the age of 18 (i.e. voting age), and who have no idea of what a filibuster is. I wanted to keep the last criteria because filibuster is a complex topic to understand for someone who does not have much interest in US domestic politics. And so I wanted to gauge whether they would understand it correctly by just reading my story.

## Interview findings and Actions to Take

| Findings                                      | Action to Take in the Next Step    |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| The topic is still too complicated to understand. | Add more explanation and break down the sections into simpler chunks. |
| Data points are fine. No more data needed. | N/A                               |
| Design elements are okay. | N/A             |
